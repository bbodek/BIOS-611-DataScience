\section{Introduction and Data Source}
  \par The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is a US organization which tracks and investigates UFO sightings. NUFORC maintains an online database of UFO reports, with almost 100,000 reports documented from 1949 to the present day. A CSV and JSON file scraped from the NUFORC public database can be found at https://data.world/timothyrenner/ufo-sightings. For each reported UFO sighting, the dataset documents a summary of the report, geographic information of where the sighting occured (city, state, longitude, latitutde), the datetime of the sighting, the shape of the unidentified object, the duration of the sighting, and the full text of the original report.

\section {Objectives}
  \par The overarching goal of this project is to uncover and examine trends in UFO sightings over time and geographic areas. More specifically, this analysis attempts to answer the following questions:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Are certain geographic areas of the US overrepresented in UFO sightings? Are there commonalities between these areas?
    \item Beyond frequency, what are the differences in characteristics the UFO sightings themselves between different geographic areas?
  \end{enumerate}
  
\section{Methodology and Results}

\subsection{Initial Data Preperation}
  \par This project downloads data from a source which has already performed some preprocessing. However, several additional steps were taken to ensure data cleanliness and useability. First, processing is performed on the datetime field detailing when the UFO sighting occured to extract the year of occurence. Next, the duration field is processed. This field contains free-form text of the reported duration of the UFO sighting. This text is processed to extract the sighting duration in numeric seconds, hours, and minutes. finally, the UFO shape field is processed to drop uncommon shapes and create a combined "Unknown/Other" category. Further processing for specific analyses will be described later. 
  
\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

  \caption{Most commonly reported UFO shapes}
  \label{fig:ufo_shapes}
\end{figure}

\par A plurality of UFO sighting shapes were categorized as Other/Unknown, followed closely by "light".

  \caption{UFO Sightings By Year: 2010-2019}
  \label{fig:ufo_sightings}
\end{figure}

\par Overall UFO sightings peaked in 2014, however there was a dramatic increase in sightings from 2018 to 2019. The American West region has the highest number of UFO sightings, even when normalized by population. The American South region has a large number of UFO sightings, however has a significantly lower sightings per population rate than the West.

  \caption{Sighting Duration by Described UFO Shape}
  \label{fig:ufo_shape}
\end{figure}

\par There is no clear trend in sighting duration by UFO "type". However, UFO sightings describes as "Flashes" have an overall shorter duration, and UFO sightings described as having changing shapes have an overall longer sighting duration.

  \includegraphics[width=0.6\linewidth]{figures/word_cloud.png}
  \caption{Wordcloud of UFO Sighting Descriptions}
  \label{fig:wordcloud}
\end{figure}
\par The most common words used to describe the UFO sightings included Light(s), Moving, Bright, and Object. 

\subsection{Trends in UFO Sightings by State}
\par After initial exploratory data analysis, a deeper analysis was conducted of trends in UFO sightings by state. For this analysis, state level population data from the US census was joined with the UFO sighting dataset.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/plot_ufo_sighting_by_population.png}
  \caption{UFO Sightings by State Population}
  \label{fig:sightings_by_pop}
\end{figure}

\par There is a clear an statistically significant inverse logarithmic relationship between state population and UFO sightings per 100k residents, i.e. states with larger populations have significantly fewer UFO sightings per resident. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{figures/ufo_sighting_by_population_density.png}
  \caption{UFO Sightings by State Population Density}
  \label{fig:sightings_by_pop_density}
\end{figure}

\par The relationship between state population density (defined as residents per square mile) and UFO sightings is not as clear, but is still highly statistically significant. It is clear that states with the highest rates of UFO sightings have low population density, and states with high population density tend to have lower rates of UFO sightings on average.

\subsection{Trends In UFO descriptions}
\par After uncovering state level trends in UFO sightings, further work was done to analyze the freeform text UFO descriptions. TF-IDF, or Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency, is a standard way to analyze the relative importance of words to a particular document. The TF (term frequency) statistic is calculated as: $tf(d,f)=\frac{f_{t,d}}{\sum_{t' \in d}f_{t',d}}$, where $f_{t,d}$ is the word count of a particular term in a particular document. 
\par \noindent The IDF (inverse document frequency) is calculated as: $idf(t,D) = log(\frac{N}{d \in D:t \in D})$.
\par \noindent Then TF-IDF is defined as $tfidf(t,d,D)=tf(t,d)*idf(t,D)$, and shows the relative importance of a term to a particular document vs other documents. 
\par A TF-IDF matrix was created where each document was the concatenation of all UFO sighting reports within a state for the year 2019 (for example, a concatenation of all UFO reports in Florida during the year 2019 makes up one of the 50 documents). A distance matrix was then computed using cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors for each pair of states as a measure of the similarity between those states. An agglomerative heirarchical clustering methodology was employed on this distance matrix to create a dendogram, a tree based diagram depicting the heirchical relationships between entities,  of similarity between state report texts. Finally, 5 clusters of states were created from the resulting dendogram, as depicted below. 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/state_dendogram.png}
  \caption{Dendogram of State UFO Sighting Report Text (with clusters circled)}
  \label{fig:state_dendogram}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/state_clusters.png}
  \caption{State Cluters (plotted with PCA)}
  \label{fig:state_clusters}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{figures/cluster_map.png}
  \caption{States Colored by Cluster}
  \label{fig:cluster_map}
\end{figure}

\par As shown in the above figure, there is some regionality to the state clusters. However, geography alone does not fully explain the clustering behavior. To explain more of the variation between cluster, an analysis was conducted comparing the population density between clusters. There were significant differences in population density between clusters, suggesting that state population density does factor into both frequency of UFO sigthings and the more qualitative descriptions of sightings from the sighting reports.

\end{figure}

\section{Further Analysis}

\par While this project attempts to take an initial dive into variation in UFO reports over time and geographical area, much is left for future analyses. A key next step is to further analyze where the differences in report text between states occur - for example do certain key words occur much more frequently in certain areas of the country. 
\par Additionally, more time series analysis should be conducted to examine trends in seasonality and correlation between scientific and popular culture events and UFO sightings (for ecxample, do popular alien related movie release dates correlated with higher frequency periods of reported UFO sightings).
