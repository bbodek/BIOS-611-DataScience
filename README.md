### Background

The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) is a US organization which tracks and investigates UFO sightings. NUFORC maintains an online database of UFO reports, with almost 100,000 reports documented from 1949 to the present day.
A CSV and JSON file scraped from the NUFORC public database can be found at https://data.world/timothyrenner/ufo-sightings, and is also available in this repository ("source_data/nofurc_reports.csv"). Each line of data in the csv details a reported UFO citing, with fields includin greport summary, city where the sighting occurred, state of sighting, datetime of sighting, shape of the unidentified object, duration of the sighting, a link to the original report, the full text of the original report, the date the sighting was posted, and the latitude and longitude of the city where the sighting occurred.
